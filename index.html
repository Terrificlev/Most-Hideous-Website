    So, Lets start talking Video games. Video games are one of the mos popular things on the internet itself. A video game is a software where you interact with obstacles and other players accordingly. An example of a video game would be Bioshock Infinite, Borderlands 4, dying light 2, Fortnite and so many more.
    Now we know the basics we can start talking about the pros and cons of them. The text past this will be useless and just plain jiberrish just to make extra space. What is the point of life if not to do random things until you dies. But because of evolution the whole random thing wouldn't work because if we didn't eat or drink we would die.
    Also trying to catch the sun would also have a very negative effect on the reproduction. So doing random things brought us really nowhere and now we have to make coordinated decisions in order to survivem which isn't as fun to actualy do something .

    What are some cons of videogames?
    Some cons are that it is relaxing and also you could fly off into the imaginary world of a videogame. Or you can play with friends annd feel the amazing gameplay together or you can do even more the thing but the meain point is that you will have fun
    although you will have top ay for most of the exeperiences and also have a console/pc but preferably pc cuz it is more powerfull especially the rtx 4090 ooooh., But anywasys it healps you havea  great time
  </div>
  <div id = "paragraph_three">
    Some conns of videogames is that the parennts or you loved one will get mad at u cuz u no do work and that ain't good so you have to keep it ia  secret or else they will get really mad at you ad also send chicott (ha ha brothers from grimbsby reference lol)
    but annyways this is kinda dumb but still read the pros or else you will not get anything at all! but annyways some cons are that some of the games are exensive and if you have a lack of money but you really want to play a game then you might eel depresion and anxiety also to play games
    you need a powerfull enough pc or console which can cost a lot of money i the process.
